# Go Data Structures <img src="https://golang.org/doc/gopher/gopherbw.png" alt="Go Gopher" height="50px"/>

Practice data structures written in Go (golang). These serve as an introduction into lower level languages like Go as well as an introduction to simple data structures.

* Hashmaps

##### Warning
